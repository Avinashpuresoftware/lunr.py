"""
lunr.Index

An index contains the built index of all documents and provides a query
interface to the index.

Usually instances of lunr.Index will not be created using this
constructor, instead lunr.Builder should be used to construct new
indexes, or lunr.Index.load should be used to load previously built and
serialized indexes.
